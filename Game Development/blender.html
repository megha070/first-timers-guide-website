        <h1>Blender</h1>
        <p>
            Blender is open-source software which has a wide range of applications in game development and animation. 
<br><br>
            The game engine is supported by online forums, which allow individuals to download graphics designed by other people, making Blender simpler for beginners to get started with.

            If you did want to customize your own graphics, it is also possible to use the rendering tools to design these so they are fit for purpose. For beginners, this may involve changing textures on objects. For instance, by adding a texture to a plane, one could make a pond, with a water pattern, or simply a block of colour to represent water.

            While Blender is compatible with Python, game logic is usually determined using the graphical user interface the software provides. This allows users to associate controls with actions. For example, one could specify that when the up arrow is pressed, the avatar should move forward one step and the sound of a footstep should be triggered.
            <br><br>
            In Blender, it is possible to package together all of the files used in the game (such as sound files and graphics) in order to make the game transportable.
