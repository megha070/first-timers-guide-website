            <p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (or Wasm) is a new portable, size as well as load-time efficient format suitable for compilation to the web. It is meant to execute code as nearly as fast as native machine code. Till now, we had been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> as the primary programming language in browsers for web development but it is not a compiled language and thus doesn't provide as much effieciency in terms of speed as compiled ones do! With WebAssembly, one can implement performance critical stuff &amp; import it like a standard JavaScript module. Thus, WebAssembly is not meant to replace JS but to complement it wherever and whenever necessary.</p>

            <p><strong>We need WebAssembly</strong> because as flexible as JavaScript is, itâ€™s still too hard to express many of the things we may want to in JavaScript, and the features we would need to make it easy might add complexity to a language that already confuses many users.</p>

            <p>Wasm is a Google, Microsoft, Apple &amp; Mozilla initiave that is intended to build a faster web. It's all open source so hop in, just read the docs &amp; get started. Here's some useful resources:</p>
