            <h3 id="prosofgit">Pros of git</h3>
            
            <ol>
            <li>git stores commits using an commit hash while mercurial does maintain only logs appended in the disk thus the unique commit hash in git being immutable results in a cleaner history.</li>
            
            <li>git provides more safety feature to prevent destructive actions when one tries to rewrite history.</li>
            
            <li>With git it is easier to go back to earlier commits and do relevant changes than mercurial.</li>
            
            <li>Branching in git is much better and killer feature as we don't need to clone the repo again for each new branch as in case of mercurial.</li>
            
            <li>No staging area in mercurial although the feature is available in the form of extensions but it is not fully fledged like that of git
            and lot more...</li>
            </ol>
