            <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a free and open source version control system. It tracks changes to specific versions of code so that previous versions can be recalled and reinstated at a later date. It also makes it easy for multiple people to work on the same files without the risk of overwriting othersâ€™ work or losing files.</p>
            
            <p>Git runs at the command line or through a git interface on your local machine. It keeps track of and maintains files in something called a <strong><em>repository</em></strong> or <strong><em>repo</em></strong>. A key feature of Git is the ability to make branches. A <strong><em>branch</em></strong> is a separate copy of the source code that allows a user to try new features and implement code without directly affecting the master branch. When a branch has successfully implemented a revision, it can be <strong><em>merged</em></strong> back into the master branch. The revision is then officially a part of the original project.</p>
            
            <p>There are also Repository Management Services which store and share Git repositories online. The most popular are:</p>
