<p>The <strong>Monty Hall problem</strong> is a probability puzzle credited to statistician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Selvin">Steve Selvin</a>, made famous by game show host Monty Hall. Steve published the puzzle and the solution in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?journalCode=utas20">The American Statistician</a>, a scientific journal in 1975.</p>

<h2 id="thepuzzle">The Puzzle</h2>

<p>Suppose that there are three doors. There is a car behind one of the doors, and goats behind the other two doors. You, as a contestant, do not know which door holds which. You are asked to pick a door. Let's say you pick door 1. The host, who knows what's behind each of the doors, opens one of the other doors, say door 3, to reveal a goat. Now you are given the option of switching your choice from door 1 to door 2. Does switching your choice increase your probability of winning the car?</p>

<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>

<p>The solution provided by Steve in 1975 and later in 1990 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant">Marilyn vos Savant</a> generated a lot of controversy and made the puzzle famous throughout the world. A number of articles and papers were published on the puzzle. Mathematicians and PhDs provided formal  proofs and computer simulations in support of the solution.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Consider the problem carefully. Your first choice, door 1, gives you a 1/3rd chance of winning the car. If you consider the other two doors as a set (door 2 and door 3), the chances of finding the car behind one of those doors is 2/3rd. Now the host opens one of those doors to reveal the goat. So the other door still retains the 2/3rd probability while your original choice has just a 1/3rd probability. So it is to your advantage to switch to door 2.</p>
