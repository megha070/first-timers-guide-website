        <h1>Syntactic Parsing</h1>
        <p>
                Syntactic parsing is the process of analysing words for grammar and arranging them such that the relationship between them is 
                shown. Its attributes include dependency and part of speech tags-
                <ul>
                <li>Dependency is analysis of binary relations between 2 lexical items or words. Each relation is represented in the form of triplets(
                  relation,governor,dependent)</li>
                
                <li> Part of Speech tagging or POS tagging - This helps in identifying each word of the sentenceas a noun,pronoun,adjective and so on.
                  It is used to improve word features and converting a word to its base(for example swimming,swam are derived from same word, swim).
                  It can also be used to removed stopwords(repeatable words that are not required for analysis like 'the','if' etc)</li> 
                  </ul>
                Motivations for syntactic parsing include machine translation, speech recognition, grammar checking, relation extraction, and question answering.
