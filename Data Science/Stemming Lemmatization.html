      <h1>Stemming</h1>
      <p>
            Heuristically removes the affixes of a word, to get to its stem (root). The end result is the non-changing portion of a word is returned. For example, the stem of amusing, amusement, and amused would be amus.
        <br>

            Algorithms used for stemming include lookup tables and suffix-stripping algorithms. The most common algorithm used for stemming is the Porter stemming algorithm.

        <h1>Lemmatization</h1>
        <p>
                Morphological analysis of a word that returns its lemma, a normalized form of a set of morphologically related forms chosen by convention. The result is that typically inflectional endings are removed and the dictionary form of a word is returned. For example, the word <q>better</q> has <q>good</q> as its lemma. The use of lemmatizers is more common than the user of stemmers, and typically returns more accurate results. 

                <br>
                Algorithms used for lemmatization can be based on dictionary lookups, Levenshtein distances, and other techniques.
