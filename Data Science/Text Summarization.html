        <h1>Text Summarization</h1>
        <p>
                The goal of text summarization is to create a concise, accurate, and sensible summary of a longer piece of text. This is a difficult problem, because in order to create a summary of the important information, one must truly understand the point of the text.  Text summarizers are essential because there is too much information in the world to summarize manually, and summaries allow us to reduce reading time, make selecting documents easier while researching, and contribute to the results of other algorithms, such as those used to answer questions. Examples of summaries are widespread, and include newspaper headlines, meeting minutes, movie previews, and sound bites.

                There are two main methods of creating summaries, extractive and abstractive. Extractive involves taking phrases or sentences directly from the source text to create a summary. Abstractive summarization is more challenging, as it involves generating entirely new phrases and sentences in an attempt to capture the meaning of the original document. Generally, regardless of the method used, the process of summarizing text using Natural Language Processing starts with interpreting the text as a whole. From there, the relevant information is extracted and condensed. Finally, the summary representation is presented to the reader in fluent, natural language.
