       <h1>TensorFlow</h1>
       <h2>Introduction</h2>
       <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow"><b>TensorFlow</b></a> is an open source software library 
        for high performance numerical computation and machine learning applications such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_networks">neural networks</a>.
         Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms viz. CPUs, GPUs, TPUs.

        Originally developed by the <a href="https://ai.google/brain-team/"><b>Google brain</b></a> team for internal <b>Google</b>
        use, until it was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015.<br>

        The name "<b>Tensor Flow</b>" has been adopted based on the multidimensional array ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor">tensors</a> ) 
        which are useful for data-driven operation such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing">Image Processing</a>,
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">Deep Learning</a>, etc.
        
         Google announced dedicated TensorFlow support for both mobile devices as well as web browsers!
        
        - <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/"><b>TensorFlow Lite</b></a>, a software stack specifically for Android Development
        - <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/"><b>TensorFlow.js</b></a>, a library for training and deploying ML models on the web
       </p>
       <h2>TensorFlow Lite</h2>
       <p>
        TensorFlow Lite is TensorFlow&apos;s lightweight solution for mobile and embedded devices. It enables on-device machine learning
         inference with low latency and a small binary size. Here, is the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/lite">documentation guide</a>!<br>
       </p>

       <br> 
        TensorFlow Lite provides an interface to leverage hardware acceleration via the <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks/index.html">Android Neural Networks API</a>,
         available on Android 8.1 (Oreo) and higher.
         <h2>TensorFlow.js</h2>
         <p>
            Tensorflow.js is a JavaScript library for training and deploying ML models in the browser and on Node.js. 
            It is built on top of low level API <a href="https://i0.wp.com/pbiswas101.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/tensorflow-js.png?ssl=1&w=450">deeplearn.js</a>
        </p>
            <img alt="image" src="https://i0.wp.com/pbiswas101.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/tensorflow-js.png?ssl=1&w=450"><br>
            
            Tensorflow.js enables the following advantage without needing to install additional drivers since it is up & running on the browser:
         <ol>   
            <li>Develop ML with JavaScript</li>
            <li> Run Existing Models</li>
            <li> Retrain Existing Models</li>
         </ol>
       <h2> Why TensorFlow?</h2>
       <p>
        TensorFlow goes deeper than just Deep Learning, it actually support tools for reinforcement learning especially with custom-made TPU.
         When it comes to compare TensorFlow with other DL frameworks (or libraries) such as <a href="http://torch.ch/">Torch</a>, <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>, <a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a> we have:<br>
       <h3>Pros</h3>
       <ol>
       <li>Python, Numpy support</li>
       <li>Good computational graph absraction</li>
        <li> Fast compile times than Theano</li>
        <li>Visualize complex graph, quantitative metrics using Tensorboard</li>
        <li>Extremely popular within the development community as of 2018</li>
       </ol>
       <h3>Cons</h3>
       <ol>
          <li>Still slower than other frameworks</li>
        <li>Not enough pre-trained models for practical use</li>
        <li>No commercial backing</li>
       </ol>
        </p>
      <h2> Open Source. Get Started</h2>
      <p>
        TensorFlow is an wonderful library. In order to build awesome models using this library you need to have prior programming
        experience using <b>Python</b>. Check out the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">official site</a> and you can also contribute
