        <h3> "Code Smell is a term used by <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile</a> programmers."   - <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">Wikipedia</a></h3>
        <h1>Wait, how can a code smell?</h1>
        <div>
                 In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">computer programming</a> a code smell may refer to anything unusual in the source code of a program that
                 probably indicates a deeper problem. The term was popularised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a> on [WardsWiki][5] in the late
                 1990s. Duplicate code, too many comments or long classes can be considered as the code smell however exact 
                 definition is subjective and varies by language, developer, and community. And yes, we are not talking about
                 literal smell which is obvious! Consider expert programmers having this hypothetical nose in their brain 
                 such that once they see a code that indicates the violation of fundamental design principles and negatively
                 impacts design quality seeks to take proper action based on their gut feeling that something might be wrong!
                 They are not technically incorrect and does not prevent the program from running instead they represent
                 weaknesses that may be slowing down development process or increasing the risks of bugs and failures in
                 the future.  In a nutshell, code smell being metaphorical smell are usually not bugs!

        <h1> How about code refactoring!</h1>
        <div>
            <h4> The Perfect Deodorant</h4>
            According to <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler">Martin Fowler</a> in his book <b>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</b>, popularized 
            the term <b>code smell</b> quite a bit that it certainly gained traction in the agile community in particular.
             Bad code smells can be an indicator of factors that contribute to technical debt. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin">Robert C Martin</a>
             (popularly known as <b>Uncle Bob</b>) calls a list of code smells a "value system" for software craftsmanship.
              Now, avoidance of bad code smells lead to elegant design principles. That is where code refactoring comes in and
              it is done to remove code smells where it is refactored in small, controlled steps, and the resulting design is 
              examined for further code smells that in turn indicate the need for more refactoring.
