            The MoSCoW method is a way for a group of people to prioritize and organize requirements for a project.
             MoSCoW is an acronym which stands for Must have, Should have, Could have and Wonâ€™t have. 
            
            <h4>Must Have:</h4>
                These are the parts of the project that absolutely must be included. They are non-negotiable requirements that must be included so that if the project was made of all Must Have components, the project would be a successful.
            
            <h4>Should Have:</h4>
                These are requirements that are important however they come in second priority to the Must Have requirements. If there is time, these requirements will most likely be added.
            
            <h4>Could Have:</h4>
                These are requirements that would be nice to have, however there is generally not enough time to include them now. 
            
            <h4>Wont Have:</h4>
                These requirements could be added at a future date but not crucial to the success of the project at this time.
