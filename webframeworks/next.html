It saves a lot of developer efforts and time. </p>
            
            <p>In building javascript applications which require client side routing and other actions required to be done at client side, and one more problem arose that of SEO because javacript need to be loaded before content and this could result in increase in page loading time.The solution to both of those problems is server rendering, also called static pre-rendering.</p>
